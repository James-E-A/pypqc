Needs "cffi" and a C compiler

- If you're on Linux, install build-tools or "Development Tools" or something like that
- If you're on Windows, https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/ AND THEN make sure you use "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022" or whatever
- First, run cffi_compile.py
- Then, run main.py and check out the demo_* functions
